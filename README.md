What is DevOps?
DevOps is a technical movement that aims to improve collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. The goal is to enhance software delivery speed, quality, and reliability by automating processes, fostering communication, and breaking down traditional silos.
Important Aspects of DevOps
1. Automation: Reducing manual intervention to minimize errors and accelerate deployments
2. Collaboration: Encouraging seamless communication between developers, system administrators, and other stakeholders.
3. Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD): Ensuring code is frequently integrated, tested, and ready for deployment.
4. Monitoring & Feedback: Tracking system performance and quickly addressing issues.

DevOps Lifecycle


DevOps Lifecycle
1. Plan — You should define requirements, create user stories and prioritize tasks.
2. Develop — This involves developers writing and building software, version control and peer reviews.
3. Build — Compile code, run automated builds
4. Test — Automated testing, security checks, performance validation.
5. Release — Preparing artifacts, approvals, change management i,e Code is packaged for deployment.
6. Deploy — Software is rolled out to servers or cloud environments.
7. Operate — Configurations are managed (e.g., using Ansible).
8. Monitor — Collect logs, track performance, gather feedback with tools like Prometheus
